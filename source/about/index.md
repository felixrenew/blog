Hello everyone, I'm felix.

This blog is built using the [`Hexo`](https://hexo.io/) system deployed on [`Vercel`](https://vercel.com/) and the program files are hosted on [`Github`](https://github.com/).

Vercel automatically builds and generates static files by pushing files with [`Markdown`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) from via Git.

The purpose of building this Blog is to log the output of learning about Engligh or some technologies. Although I've worked many years, there is a lack of effective output, whether it is in Chinese or English.

By learning technology articles or documents to practice the reading of English and vocabulary. On the other hand, enforcing to output English articles or technology articles can practice writing in English.

At present, I do a draft in Chinese first, and then try to translate it into English. I usually use DeepL to translate or check my articles.
In the future, I hope to be able to write articles in English directly.

Come on come onÔºÅ
